# About

This repo: learning, experimenting, having fun.

Much of code in this repository is written fast completion as a goal.

Until June 1st I am using a lot of time getting rank up on CW. (Registered there in June 2020, will be 1 year since)

After that I'm planning putting more time in Dev things, less in DSA.
